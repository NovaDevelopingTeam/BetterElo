Yout resolution time will be compared with the resolution time of the same equation by the player with the nearest elo to yours.\n\nHow does the elo work?\nIf you lose, your elo will decrease based on this scheme where x is the enemy's elo and y is your's elo:\nx > 100 + y: -6 elo\nx > 50 + y < 100 + y: -9 elo\nx > y < 50 + y: -12 elo\nx < y > 50 - y: -21 elo\nx < 50 - y > 100 - y: -29 elo\nx < 100 - y: -38 elo\n\nAt the same time, if you win your elo will encrease based on this scheme where x represents your's elo and y the enemy's elo\nx > 100 + y: +6 di elo\nx > 50 + y < 100 + y: +9 di elo\nx > y < 50 + y: +12 di elo\nx < y > 50 - y: +21 di elo\nx < 50 - y > 100 - y: +29 di elo\nx < 100 - y: +38 di elo",
